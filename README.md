# E-commerce-Power-BI-Dashboard
      This project is about exploring the e-commerce marketplace using Jumia foods and Glovo foods as case studies. The both platforms being among the leading e-commerce marketplace in various countries, not just here in Nigeria.
We explored both e-commerce platforms by conducting market research on their apps and also on their websites, from which we extracted the vendors list that we further used to create a database. Also, survey questionnaires were created, then data cleaning, analysis and visualization were done.
